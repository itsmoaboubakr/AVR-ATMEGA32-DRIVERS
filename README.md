# AVR-ATMEGA32-DRIVERS
This repository contains a collection of drivers and libraries specifically designed for the ATmega32 microcontroller. These drivers provide convenient and efficient interfaces to interact with various peripherals and features of the ATmega32, enabling developers to build robust and feature-rich applications.

## Key Features

- DIO Driver: Simplifies the configuration and control of General Purpose Input/Output pins.
- ADC Driver: Provides an intuitive API to initialize and utilize the ADC module for accurate analog signal measurement.
- External Interrupt Driver: Offers utilities for handling external interrupts on specific pins.
- Global Interrupt Driver: Provides functions for enabling and disabling global interrupts.
- Timer Driver: Provides a high-level interface for configuring and utilizing the Timer/Counter modules for precise timing, event counting, and PWM generation.
- ICU Driver: Facilitates input capture functionality, allowing precise time measurement and event detection. module for accurate analog signal measurement.
- Watchdog Driver: Simplifies the configuration and control of the Watchdog Timer for system reset and fault detection.
- TWI Driver: Offers functions for I2C communication using the Two-Wire Interface (TWI) module.
- SPI Driver: Provides functions for SPI communication using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) module.
- UART Driver: Offers functions for serial communication using the UART module.
- EEPROM Driver: Facilitates read and write operations to the EEPROM for non-volatile data storage.
